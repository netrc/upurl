upurl
=====

chrome extension for easier navigation of the current URL

Text from chrome extension webstore....

Simple, unobtrusive utility that helps navigate websites. Clicking on the icon will display a list of URLs, each one based on the current tab's URL with subdirectories deleted one-by-one. This allows you to go to exactly where you want to in the site's URL hierarchy without having to find the 'home' or other exact link on the page.

Free, no ads, no analytics.
